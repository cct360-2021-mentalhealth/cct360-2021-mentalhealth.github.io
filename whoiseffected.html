      <h2>Global prevalence</h2>
      <p>Mental health can be seen as an unstable continuum, where an individual's mental health may have many different possible values. Mental wellness is generally viewed as a positive attribute, even if the person does not have any diagnosed
        mental health condition. This definition of mental health highlights emotional well-being, the capacity to live a full and creative life, and the flexibility to deal with life's inevitable challenges. Some discussions are formulated in terms
        of contentment or happiness.Many therapeutic systems and self-help books offer methods and philosophies espousing strategies and techniques vaunted as effective for further improving the mental wellness. Positive psychology is increasingly
        prominent in mental health.</p>
      <p>A holistic model of mental health generally includes concepts based upon anthropological, educational, psychological, religious, and sociological perspectives. There are also models as theoretical perspectives from personality, social,
        clinical, health and developmental psychology.</p>
      <p>The tripartite model of mental well-being views mental well-being as encompassing three components of emotional well-being, social well-being, and psychological well-being. Emotional well-being is defined as having high levels of positive
        emotions, whereas social and psychological well-being are defined as the presence of psychological and social skills and abilities that contribute to optimal functioning in daily life. The model has received empirical support across
        cultures.The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) is the most widely used scale to measure the tripartite model of mental well-being.</p>
      <h4>Children and young adults</h4>
      <p>According to 2020 data, mental illnesses have a stagnant incidence among adults but are increasing among the youth, categorized as 12 to 17-year-olds. Approximately 13% of youth in the United States reported suffering from at least one major
        depressive episode in 2019-20, with the greatest increase (18%) in Oregon. Only 28% receive consistent treatment and 70% are left untreated. In lower-income communities, it is more common to forego treatment as a result of financial
        resources. Being left untreated also leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance use, which in turn causes its own host of mental health issues.</p>
      <h4>Homeless Population</h4>
      <p>Mental illness is not only prevalent among children and young adults but also the homeless. Mental illness is thought to be extremely prevalent among homeless populations, though access to proper diagnoses is limited. In an article written
        by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith’s research on the prevalence of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated, "Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder." What this quote is saying is that being
        homeless itself can cause the emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause the emotional disorder. Godman’s article stated
        "Recently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Missouri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984),
        she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD."
      </p>
      <h4>Immigrants and Refugees</h4>
      <p>The Rohingya from Myanmar are a large group of stateless people who experienced war, deprivation of social rights, and other cultural and political instability and they are currently residing in the southeastern part of Bangladesh as
        refugees. There are very little research has been done on their mental health status due to war, daily environmental stressors due to continuous displacement, historical trauma, and life in the refugee camp.</p>
      <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 148 Rohingya adults in the refugee camp in Bangladesh and the result indicated that people are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, somatic impairment, and other
        associated functional impairment as well. this study revealed that all these MHCs developed due to the high level of daily environmental stressors in the camp, also due to lack of food, lack of freedom of movement.</p>
      <h4>Cultural and religious considerations</h4>
      <p>Mental health is a socially constructed and socially defined concept; that is, different societies, groups, cultures, institutions, and professions have very different ways of conceptualizing its nature and causes, determining what is
        mentally healthy, and deciding what interventions, if any, are appropriate. Thus, different professionals will have different cultural, class, political and religious backgrounds, which will impact the methodology applied during treatment. In
        the context of deaf mental health care, it is necessary for professionals to have cultural competency of deaf and hard of hearing people and to understand how to properly rely on trained, qualified, and certified interpreters when working
        with culturally Deaf clients.
